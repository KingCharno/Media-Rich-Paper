<p><font color="Blue"><h2>INTRO</h2></font> League of Legends is one of the most popular competitive game with a very popular cometitive scene, players worldwide,
a Netflix orginal series, now counting 5 successful spin-off games-you get it; Riot Games has been very successful with League of Legends. A game where a team of 5
are pitted against a team of five each playing different characters with their respective playstyles, moves, classes, and narrative. But how do you tell a story in
a game that is only interested in being a competative multiplayer game? Riot has answered with... you don't. Allow me to explain; The most you will get out of League
of Legends is a one sided interaction from your own characters perspective on another character that they encounter. Riot has religated their story telling to outside
media that explains the origins, characteristiscs, and actions of a character and then have the gameplay reflect that narrative. An example I want to discuss is Viego:
The Ruined King.

<p><font color="red"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>You'd never consciously notice it, but look again at the very brightest portion of the background! See that shape
that descends? This is precisely what Barthes is after--a detail that makes us find an obvious representation "real."</p><p>
Barthes describes such images as follows: <font color="red"><h2>QUOTE FROM THE READINGS</h2></font>"the singularity of the descriptive (or of the 'useless detail') in the
narrative fabric, its isolatedness, brings up a question of primary importance for the structural analysis of narrative" <font color="red"><h2>CITATION</h2></font><font color=green>(Barthes, "The Reality Effect" p. 12).</font>
