<p><h3><font color="Green"><h2>TITLE</h2></font>The Ruined King: How gameplay reflects design</h3></p>

<p><font color="green"><h2>INTRO</h2></font>League of Legends (LoL) is one of the most popular game with players world wide, a popular competitive scene, and an ever expansive IP containing one of the most divers
 and colorful cast of characters (which is now over 180 characters and counting). The gameplay is simple, you have 2 teams of 5 players playing a character of their choice with different moves, playstyles, and classes trying
 to destroy the opposing team's towers and nexus at their base. With a successful game, a Netflix exclusive animated series based on a handful of LoL's characters, and now 4 successful spin off narative based games based on LoL
 ;there is no wonder why Riot Games (the developers of LoL) became an industry leader in the gaming sphere. They took the time to not only develope the game but also develope that IP and especially the stars of the show, the characters.</p>

<p><font color="green"><h2>THESIS STATEMENT</h2></font>One of the characters I want to discuss is Viego: The Ruined King. I want to discuss how his narative and design is a clever subversion of expectations, and how the gameplay
  reflects that and how it affects the player.

<p><font color="red"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>You'd never consciously notice it, but look again at the very brightest portion of the background! See that shape
that descends? This is precisely what Barthes is after--a detail that makes us find an obvious representation "real."</p><p>
Barthes describes such images as follows: <font color="red"><h2>QUOTE FROM THE READINGS</h2></font>"the singularity of the descriptive (or of the 'useless detail') in the
narrative fabric, its isolatedness, brings up a question of primary importance for the structural analysis of narrative" <font color="red"><h2>CITATION</h2></font><font color=green>(Barthes, "The Reality Effect" p. 12).</font>
