<p><h3><font color="Green"><h2>TITLE</h2></font>The Ruined King: How gameplay reflects design</h3></p>

<p><font color="green"><h2>INTRO</h2></font>League of Legends (LoL) is one of the most popular game with players world wide, a popular competitive scene, and an ever expansive IP containing one of the most divers
 and colorful cast of characters (which is now over 180 characters and counting). The gameplay is simple, you have 2 teams of 5 players playing a character of their choice with different moves, playstyles, and classes trying
 to destroy the opposing team's towers and nexus at their base. With a successful game, a Netflix exclusive animated series based on a handful of LoL's characters, and now 4 successful spin off narative based games based on LoL
 ;there is no wonder why Riot Games (the developers of LoL) became an industry leader in the gaming sphere. They took the time to not only develope the game but also develope that IP and especially the stars of the show, the characters.</p>

<p><font color="green"><h2>THESIS STATEMENT</h2></font>One of the characters I want to discuss is Viego: The Ruined King. I want to discuss how his narative and design is a clever subversion of expectations, and how the gameplay
  reflects that and how it affects the player.

<p><font color="green"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>Viego's story is a tragic one with him suddenly becoming king of Camavor after his older brother dies. Not knowing much about being king, he had power thrusted on him and thus he was reluctant
 to take that responsibilty. He notices a humble seamstress, a commoner who he swiftly falls in love with. After marrying her and obsessing over his love, he quickly made enemies internally in his kingdom due to his neglect of the responsibilities
 of being a king and instead putting all of his focus on his queen. There was bound to be negative reprocussions, like an attempt at his life, a poisoned dagger intended for Viego misses its mark and instead heits the queen. With no cure or antidote
 available Viego sends his niece who is head of the royal guard to find a cure. By the time she returns from her venture with a way to save the queen, it was too late. She had died; enraged, Viego demands to know where this cure is, His niece advised that
 the people from which she found the cure said that their living water only cures and heals, it does nothing to the already dead. Despite this, he goes with his army to take the living water by force. Enchanted sword passed down from generations in hand
 Viego takes siege to the island and gets to the living waters. Placing the body, Isolde revives as a specter, angered by the actions of Viego, recognizeing who stands before her as no longer the man she fell in love with,
 she takes his enchanted sword and plunges it through his heart. The unholy mixture of magic from the living waters, the enchanted sword, and the dead created, the Ruined King. Able to controle the dead and place them in a state of death and
 life. He will do anything to get his queen back, no matter who stands in his way."real."</p><p>

<p>Viego is a tall, lean young looking man despite his actual age being ancient, he controls the dead and his sword with the magical propertis of taking the strength and power from an individual to continuously increase its
 own strngth. Despite all of this Viego is a clever subversion in almost every aspect of his design. He is a young and conventionally attractive guy that wears leather and is shirtless. You would think someone called the Ruined King to be an old
 ancient man with a large stature, bearded and tired. At the begining of the stury, if you didn't read the tit;e of this essay, you probably would have thought Viego would have been the protagonist or at the very least a hero. Or a Romeo-esque
 character (that is certainly what he would think of himself as) but he ends up being the antagonist that sets in motion the very thing that might end the world so he can have his queen back. Viego is no king, he was a spoiled brat that had power given to him
 with no sense of responsibility, only wanting what is 'rightfully' his.</p>
 
 <p> The question becomes how do you tell this story in a game that is only interested in being a replayable esport? Riot Games answers, you don't. All of what I told you aside from the visual design of Viego is told through outside media. In websites with
  colorstories, animated shorts that take place in the present time when Viego is unleashed, and a novel adaptation that is the definitive way to experience the story. So the question then becomes; how do you reflect all of this story and ,ake the player feel
  what the character feels to excel at him? How did Riot adapt Viego into a playable character that stayed true to his narrative, themes, and visuals?

<p>Riot Games kept one thing consisten about Viego and it's his attitude towards things he wants, things he thinks are rightfully his. It is important to not that most of what I am about to explain is largely annecdotal, meaning from my own experience, and what
 Riot developers have stated their goal was in the design process for Viego. As the Video above explains, Viego reaves health by landing abilities and pocesses the dead bodies of the deceased. The possession of dead enemies is especially powerful if the enemy in
 question has been doing well. From my experience, he is taking the win that the enemy has and making it rightfully his. This comes with the catch of you needing to actually be good at the character and his designated role, but this is ingenius if you ask me.</P>
 
<p>This is where I relate all that I have talked about witht the course Behind the Screen. We had discussed as a class the topics of Affect and emotion and Brian Massumi who discusses the defference and why it's important to know this. The main thing that I want 
 you the reader to keep in mind is the idea of empathetically placing what the player feels on to the character in question, or the player reciprocating the feeling of the character and their attiude towards their situations. I mentioned in my discussion the idea
 of a headcanon in which their is a difference in what is actually canon by the original developers and what is in the players head based on the original concept. Earlier in this essay I mentione how Viego would certainly consider himself a tragic hero like Romeo
 the univers from which Viego comes from does not have a concept of Romeo and Juliet, or Shakespear for that matter. Despite the world relatively being fantasy it has nothing to do with our world history. My 'Headcanon' of Viego is based on what he as a character
 has done in his own context and I made an assumption of what he would do based on this.</p>

<p>"t is not that there are no philosophical antecedents to draw
on. It is just that they are not the usual ones for cultural theory.
Spinoza is a formidable philosophical precursor on many of these
points: on the difference in nature between affect and emotion; on the irreducibly bodily and autonomic nature of affect; on affect as
a suspension of action-reaction circuits and linear temporality in a
sink of what might be called "passion," to distinguish it both from
passivity and activity; on the equation between affect and effect;
on the form/content of conventional discourse as constituting an
autonomous or semi-autonomous stratum running counter to the
full registering of affect and its affirmation, its positive develop-
ment, its expression as and for itself. The title of Spinoza's central
work suggests a designation for the project of thinking affect:
 Ethics."</P>

<p> Where does this leave us? Well Viego was the antagonist of the story so it is quite obvious that he would be defeated but the writers and the developers made sure to note that he was not killed. He lies frozen in a state that is lost to time. He would be freed but
 it wont be soon that we will see him. The way the heros defeat him is by taking a gun that revives the victem of a killer when it kills the killer and shooting the specter of Viegos queen. Essentially, revivng Viego and stripping him of his undead powers, and then freezing
 him in time. But he will come back and now he no longer has the thing he live-LOVED for. But we can still play as Viego in LoL. It is an esport with no narrative and with replayability.
